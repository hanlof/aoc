# All of the stuff below but now also 2023

2023 is incomplete but something like 75% of the stars are done

# My advent of Code 2022 solutions

All written in python (python3)

Computing both answers for all days in sequence takes less than 20s on my system which I think is decent!

Try it: <code>$ time for f in day*.py; do python3 $f; done</code>

Also includes a neat bash script for fetching the input for a given day, it will automatically look for auth cookies in your firefox profiles
meaning the script will be able to authenticate as you if you have previously logged in using firefox (and allowed the cookie).

Also includes python utility functions for getting output and printing timing

Also includes a runner script that measures timing on the separate AOC challanges by looking at its output
I much prefer to be able to write the solutions for each challenge without any restrictions such as implementing certain functions
When they are done they print "Part 1: <ans>\nPart 2: <ans2>" and that's it. No other bounds on the implementation of the separate tasks.

The solutions are far from perfect but they get the job done and could hopefully be instructive.
I've been exploring different ways to solve problems here and some are pretty nice!
