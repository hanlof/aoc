# My advent of Code 2022 solutions

All written in python (python3)

Computing both answers for all days in sequence takes less than 20s on my system which I think is decent!

Try it: <code>$ time for f in day*.py; do python3 $f; done</code>

Also includes a neat bash script for fetching the input for a given day, it will automatically look for auth cookies in your firefox profiles
meaning it will automagically be able to log in to adventofcode.com if you have logged in using firefox.

There is still a lot to improve in here. You will find wierd stuff, unreadable code, bad spelling and lots of other fun stuff.
